# Capstone--Swiggy-Funnel-Analysis
I looked into how food orders work and studied the Session Details sheet to figure out changes in the number of orders. I checked how website traffic varied compared to the same day last week and looked at overall conversion rates over time. This project gives a detailed understanding of how people order food online.
💡 I came up with ideas and checked them using data to explain why conversion rates might change. 💻
